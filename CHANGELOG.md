## Unreleased

### Added

### Changed

### Fixed

## 0.1.3 — 2026-04-27

### Added

- CLIO.md is auto-loaded as the canonical project instruction file.
  The loader merges sections from CLAUDE.md, AGENTS.md, CODEX.md, and
  GEMINI.md into the same compiled prompt, with CLIO.md winning on
  conflicts. `--no-context-files` still skips the entire chain.
- `clio targets convert <id> --runtime <runtimeId>` rewrites an existing
  endpoint's runtime in-place. Used to migrate `openai-compat` targets
  pointing at LM Studio or Ollama onto their native runtimes.
- `clio doctor` now fingerprints `openai-compat` URLs and warns when
  the URL responds as LM Studio or Ollama, suggesting the convert
  command.
- `clio configure` and `clio targets add` detect native local servers
  on the entered URL and offer to switch the runtime to the native
  counterpart.
- Live tool output streaming: `tool_execution_update` events now
  accumulate into the expanded tool block with a dim `(running...)`
  marker. Previously partial output was invisible until the call
  finished.
- Bash success results render `$ <command>` on its own line under
  the rail before the output, matching the experience of a real
  terminal.
- `Ctrl+T` toggles the most recent assistant turn's thinking block
  between a one-line dim preview and a full rail-prefixed body.
  Symmetric with the existing `Ctrl+O` tool-segment toggle
  (`clio.thinking.expand`, default `ctrl+t`).
- Footer shows the current git branch as `branch:<name>` when
  launched from inside a repository. One-shot at boot via a new
  `src/utils/git.ts` helper.

### Changed

- Identity messaging aligns Clio Coder with its position in IOWarp's
  CLIO ecosystem of agentic science. The system prompt fragment, the
  CLIO.md identity section, the README opening, the package.json
  description and keywords, the CLI help text, the orchestrator
  banner subtitle, and the chat-loop fallback identity now reflect
  the HPC and scientific-software focus and the NSF-funded IOWarp
  project. Architecture, engine boundaries, runtime selection, and
  test surfaces are unchanged. No behavior changes.
- `package.json` `files` no longer references AGENTS.md, STATUS.md,
  or GOVERNANCE.md (the files were never shipped). CLIO.md is
  published instead.
- README.md and CONTRIBUTING.md document CLIO.md instead of
  AGENTS.md.
- `lmstudio-native` evicts non-target loaded models before each prompt
  (within a 60-second cache) so the active model owns VRAM and does
  not spill into system RAM.
- `ollama-native` pins the active model with `keep_alive: -1`. The
  chat-loop hot-swap path fires a one-shot `keep_alive: 0` sweep
  against other resident models so the prior pinned weights release.
- `llamacpp-completion` and `llamacpp-anthropic` probes report a
  diagnostic note when the configured wire model id does not match
  the server's single loaded model.
- CI now installs `fd-find` on `ubuntu-latest` so slash-autocomplete
  `@path` completion is exercised on every push.
- CI gains a `clean-clone-smoke` job that runs the full gate against
  a fresh shallow checkout with no npm cache, so dev-tree-only test
  passes surface before tagging.

### Fixed

- Slash-autocomplete `@path` completion now resolves `fd` or `fdfind`
  from PATH instead of hardcoding `fd`, fixing CI on `ubuntu-latest`
  and Debian/Ubuntu users with the `fd-find` apt package.
- `clio --dev` accepts `CLIO_DEV_ALLOW_PROTECTED_BRANCH=1` as a
  boot-time opt-out for the protected-branch guard. Mirrors the
  existing `CLIO_DEV_ALLOW_ENGINE_WRITES=1` pattern; the per-write
  guard remains in force.

## 0.1.2 — 2026-04-25

### Added

- Interactive chat now retries transient provider and stream failures using
  session retry settings. Retry boundaries, cancellation, exhaustion, and
  recovery are visible in the transcript and persisted for resume/fork replay.
- Tool and bash transcript lines now show clearer running/success/error status
  with bash command previews and elapsed time in live and replayed transcripts.
  Tool segments collapse by default with per-tool sublines, and `Ctrl+O`
  toggles full-output expansion through the keybindings manager.
- Edit-tool results render a unified diff preview alongside the structured
  tool-execution block.
- Settings overlay exposes retry controls (`retry.enabled`, `retry.maxRetries`,
  `retry.baseDelayMs`, `retry.maxDelayMs`) so users can tune retry behavior
  without hand-editing `settings.yaml`.
- The interactive TUI now opens with a Clio Coder dashboard showing target,
  model registry, context, latency, and worker-profile status. Interactive
  startup no longer prints a separate legacy banner above the dashboard.
- `/hotkeys` supports row selection, a read-only keybinding detail panel, and
  legacy-terminal warnings when user bindings require CSI-u support.
- Editor prompt rails reflect the active mode: default uses the terminal
  foreground, advise uses amber, super uses red.
- Slash-command autocomplete: typing `/` opens a filtered dropdown of every
  built-in command, and Tab accepts the selected entry.
- `/resume` picker now shows a one-line conversation preview, message count,
  and relative time per session.
- Prompt assembly auto-loads project context files (`AGENTS.md`, `CODEX.md`,
  `CLAUDE.md`) walking from the working directory upward; pass
  `--no-context-files` (alias `-nc`) to disable.
- Run receipts now carry per-tool stats (loops, errors, blocked attempts,
  parallel batches) emitted by worker telemetry hooks.
- `clio targets --json` exposes `detectedReasoning` and
  `reasoningCandidateModelId` so the `/thinking` probe state is observable
  from the CLI.
- Compaction summaries persist `triggerReason` and `tokensAfter` in the
  session entry stream, leaving a queryable trail for every `/compact`.
- Audit JSONL is now a five-arm discriminated union over `kind`: `tool_call`,
  `mode_change`, `abort` (sources `dispatch_abort`, `dispatch_drain`,
  `stream_cancel`), `session_park`, `session_resume`. Safety subscribes on
  start, unhooks on stop, and fsyncs every row. Integration coverage lives
  in `tests/integration/audit-{mode-transitions,run-aborts,session-lifecycle}.test.ts`.
- `tools.web_fetch` honors the abort signal end-to-end; bash abort coverage
  now includes a success-then-abort guard.

### Changed

- Slash-command help and autocomplete present only canonical commands:
  `/model`, `/quit`, and `/receipts [verify <runId>]` replace duplicate
  spellings such as `/models`, `/exit`, and `/receipt verify <runId>`.
- Provider catalog and cloud defaults realign with `pi-ai` 0.70.2; the
  `@mariozechner/pi-*` line is pinned to 0.70.x with a current lock at 0.70.2.
- Worker tool-call path validates once and threads telemetry hooks so the
  agent loop, dispatch board, and receipts share one source of truth.
- Mode fragments must now enumerate the matrix tool set; a new regression
  test pins per-mode tool resolution and toggle re-resolution so future drift
  between `MODE_MATRIX` and the chat-loop fails fast.

### Fixed

- Retrying a transient failure continues from the existing user turn instead
  of duplicating it in model context.
- Cancelling an interactive run cancels any pending retry countdown and
  forwards abort signals into bash tool subprocesses.
- The last failed assistant message is pruned from live model context on
  every terminal exit of the retry chain so live state matches what
  `/resume` and `/fork` rebuild from the persisted transcript.
- A retryable error thrown from `agent.prompt` persists the original error
  as a visible failed assistant entry instead of surfacing only as a
  `[retry]` status line.
- Bash subprocess abort escalates to `SIGKILL` after a 5-second `SIGTERM`
  grace period so commands that trap or ignore `SIGTERM` no longer hang
  the chat-loop.
- Bash commands that exceed the 2 MB output cap report
  `command output exceeded N bytes` instead of a generic `SIGTERM`
  termination.
- `/resume`, `/fork`, and `/new` abort an in-flight agent run before
  reseating context so a pending retry-chain `agent.continue()` cannot race
  the new session's messages.
- Retry status lines render byte-identically in the live transcript and
  after `/resume` by sharing a single formatter.
- Streamed responses that emitted partial text before failing render both
  the partial output and the terminal error indicator together.
- Failed turns with empty usage no longer write zero-token rows to the
  observability ledger.
- User-facing product labels consistently say Clio Coder instead of mixing
  lowercase command-name branding into headers, prompts, and status text.
- Provider hot-swap on a same-endpoint model switch now updates the live
  agent without rebuilding the chat-loop, and stale model state is hardened
  on every swap surface.
- `lmstudio-native` preserves reasoning content, drops `<think>` tags, and
  forces `toolUse` on tool calls so `/thinking` and `clio run` behave on
  LM Studio backends.
- `openai-compat` tool schemas and reasoning probe align so `/thinking`
  and `clio run` work against local llama.cpp / vLLM / SGLang servers.
- Dismissing the Alt+S super-mode overlay emits a `request_cancelled`
  `mode_change` audit row instead of dropping the transition silently.

## 0.1.1 — 2026-04-24

### Added

- Interactive prompt compilation now loads project context files from the
  current working directory upward. `AGENTS.md` and `CODEX.md` are injected in
  deterministic parent-to-child order when present.

### Fixed

- Session resume, fork, and tree-switch replay now read the rich session entry
  stream instead of only legacy user/assistant turns, so compaction summaries,
  branch summaries, bash/tool entries, custom display entries, system notes,
  and checkpoints are visible when present.
- Interactive tool calls and results are now written as durable session entries
  so tool work remains visible after resume and fork.
- Resuming a session whose JSONL tail is metadata no longer resets the next
  turn parent to `null`; the interactive loop now derives the resumed leaf
  from the persisted tree.
- CLI-backed subprocess runtimes now dispatch through the native worker entry
  instead of running inline in the orchestrator process.
- Out-of-tree SDK runtime plugins now pass runtime descriptor validation and
  rehydrate correctly inside native worker subprocesses.
- `/receipt verify <runId>` now verifies a SHA-256 integrity field against the
  persisted run ledger entry instead of accepting schema-valid receipt JSON.
- Dispatch heartbeats now promote stale/dead worker states into run state and
  the live dispatch board instead of leaving silent workers marked running.
- `npm run check:boundaries` now exists for the boundary command documented in
  contributor guidance.

## 0.1.0-exp — 2026-04-24

First public release. Experimental. Expect moving surfaces; pin the tag if
you need a stable target.

### What ships

- **Interactive TUI.** Terminal chat with target and model controls, session
  navigation, resume/fork, markdown-rendered replies, configurable
  keybindings, a searchable resume picker, scoped-model cycling, a
  live-updating dispatch board, and receipts/cost overlays.
- **CLI lifecycle.** `clio`, `clio configure`, `clio targets`, `clio models`,
  `clio auth`, `clio doctor`, `clio reset`, `clio uninstall`, `clio agents`,
  `clio run`, `clio upgrade`, `clio --version`.
- **Target-first configuration.** Local HTTP engines, cloud APIs,
  OAuth/subscription runtimes, and CLI-backed runtimes all live in
  `targets[]`; `orchestrator` and `workers` point at those ids. Known and
  discovered models are surfaced through `clio models` and the TUI model
  selector.
- **Runtime coverage.** Native subprocess worker; protocol adapters for
  openai-compat, llamacpp, Ollama, vLLM, SGLang, LM Studio, Lemonade;
  cloud adapters for Anthropic, OpenAI, Google, Groq, Mistral, OpenRouter,
  Bedrock; OAuth path for openai-codex (ChatGPT Plus/Pro via Codex);
  CLI-backed runtimes for Codex CLI, Claude Code CLI, Gemini CLI, Copilot
  CLI, OpenCode CLI; and a Claude Agent SDK worker path.
- **Seven builtin agents.** `scout`, `planner`, `researcher`, `reviewer`,
  `delegate`, `context-builder`, `worker`. Plain Markdown specs with
  frontmatter in `src/domains/agents/builtins/`.
- **Dispatch and workers.** `clio run` spawns OS-isolated worker
  subprocesses with NDJSON IPC and heartbeats. Named worker profiles
  let the interactive session fan out across multiple runtimes.
- **Self-development mode.** Hot-reload and restart-required signals for
  developers editing Clio from inside Clio, with shell environment isolation
  and tool guards.
- **Receipts and audit.** Every run writes a receipt under
  `<dataDir>/receipts/<runId>.json` with token counts and USD cost.
- **Safety model.** Three modes (`default`, `advise`, `super`) gate tool
  visibility at the registry. Hardcoded Bash kill-switches live in
  `damage-control-rules.yaml`.
- **State layout.** XDG-aware, with `CLIO_HOME` plus `CLIO_CONFIG_DIR` /
  `CLIO_DATA_DIR` / `CLIO_CACHE_DIR` overrides for sandboxed installs.

### Known limits

- Windows is best-effort until a later release.
- The self-dev harness is a developer convenience, not a polished public
  surface.
- Some runtime slots (remote fan-out, broader MCP) are scaffolded but not
  admitted by dispatch yet.

### Verification

- `npm run ci` gates typecheck, lint, unit/integration/boundary tests,
  production build, and e2e spawn + pty tests.
